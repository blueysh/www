          Throughout the course, I learned greatly from the 12 principles of
          animation. Applying them into animation and reading about other
          historical uses improved my knowledge about them. I also deepened my
          skills with animation softwares and techniques, and creating
          characters and stories. I'm confident the things I learned will be
          useful in future courses and projects.
