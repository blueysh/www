          I&apos;m a full-stack developer based in the United States. Right now,
          I&apos;m a student at Newton College & Career Academy in the Computer
          Science pathway. My goal is to build valuable experiences for people
          through software.
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-[600px] mb-2">
          For frontend, I use Next.js and Tailwind. For backend, I typically use
          Spring with Java but am learning Nest.js. I&apos;m always looking to
          learn new things and improve my skills.

          Outside of coding, I work at Chick-fil-A as a Team Captain. I&apos;ve
          been working there for over a year now. I&apos;ve learned a lot about
          leadership and teamwork. For fun, I like to play video games and
          listen to music (I play piano too).
